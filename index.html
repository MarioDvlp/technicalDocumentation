            <article>
                <p>A function definition is an executable statement. Its execution binds the function name in the current local namespace to a function object (a wrapper around the executable code for the function). This function object contains a reference to the current global namespace as the global namespace to be used when the function is called.</p>

                <p>The function definition does not execute the function body; this gets executed only when the function is called.</p>
                    
                <p>A function definition may be wrapped by one or more decorator expressions. Decorator expressions are evaluated when the function is defined, in the scope that contains the function definition. The result must be a callable, which is invoked with the function object as the only argument. The returned value is bound to the function name instead of the function object. Multiple decorators are applied in nested fashion. For example, the following code:</p>
                    <code>
                        @f1(arg)<br>
                        @f2<br>
                        def func(): pass
                    </code>
                
                <p>is roughly equivalent to:</p>
                <code>
                    def func(): pass<br>
                    func = f1(arg)(f2(func))
                </code>

            <article>
                <p>While The Python Language Reference describes the exact syntax and semantics of the Python language, this library reference manual describes the standard library that is distributed with Python. It also describes some of the optional components that are commonly included in Python distributions.</p>

                <p>Python’s standard library is very extensive, offering a wide range of facilities as indicated by the long table of contents listed below. The library contains built-in modules (written in C) that provide access to system functionality such as file I/O that would otherwise be inaccessible to Python programmers, as well as modules written in Python that provide standardized solutions for many problems that occur in everyday programming. Some of these modules are explicitly designed to encourage and enhance the portability of Python programs by abstracting away platform-specifics into platform-neutral APIs.</p>
                    
                <p> Python installers for the Windows platform usually include the entire standard library and often also include many additional components. For Unix-like operating systems Python is normally provided as a collection of packages, so it may be necessary to use the packaging tools provided with the operating system to obtain some or all of the optional components. </p>

            <article>
                <p>This reference manual describes the syntax and “core semantics” of the language. It is terse, but attempts to be exact and complete. The semantics of non-essential built-in object types and of the built-in functions and modules are described in The Python Standard Library. For an informal introduction to the language, see The Python Tutorial. For C or C++ programmers, two additional manuals exist: Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter describes the high-level picture of how to write a Python extension module, and the Python/C API Reference Manual describes the interfaces available to C/C++ programmers in detail.</p>

                <p>Python HOWTOs are documents that cover a single, specific topic, and attempt to cover it fairly completely.

                <p>This document describes how to write modules in C or C++ to extend the Python interpreter with new modules. Those modules can not only define new functions but also new object types and their methods. The document also describes how to embed the Python interpreter in another application, for use as an extension language. Finally, it shows how to compile and link extension modules so that they can be loaded dynamically (at run time) into the interpreter, if the underlying operating system supports this feature.</p>

                <p>This document assumes basic knowledge about Python. For an informal introduction to the language, see The Python Tutorial. The Python Language Reference gives a more formal definition of the language. The Python Standard Library documents the existing object types, functions and modules (both built-in and written in Python) that give the language its wide application range.</p>

                <h3>Phyton For Loops</h3>
                <p>A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

                This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.
                    
                With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.</p>
                <code>
                    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
                    for x in fruits:
                      print(x) 
                </code>
            
                <h3>Looping Through a String</h3>
                <p>Even strings are iterable objects, they contain a sequence of characters:</p>
                <code>
                    for x in "banana":
                    print(x)
                </code>

                <h3>The break Statement</h3>   
                <p>Exit the loop when x is "banana":</p>
                <code>
                    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
                    for x in fruits:
                      print(x)
                      if x == "banana":
                        break
                </code>
